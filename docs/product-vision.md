# CocktailChooser Product Vision

## 1. Core Purpose

CocktailChooser is a smart tool for casual home bartenders.

It helps people quickly decide what to drink based on:
- What they feel like
- What ingredients they have in their home bar
- What they have already tried recently

It is not:
- A cocktail encyclopedia
- Professional bar software
- A POS system
- Inventory management software

It is frictionless drink decision support for home use.

## 2. Target Persona

**Primary audience: Casual home bartenders**

They typically:
- Mix drinks occasionally (weekends, gatherings, holidays)
- Own a modest but growing home bar
- Think in ingredients more than cocktail names
- Want help deciding, not studying
- Prefer a quick answer over perfect classification

They often say:
- "What can I make with orange juice?"
- "I want something creamy."
- "Surprise me."
- "I don't want what I had last night."

They usually do not need:
- Pro bartender workflows
- POS features
- Inventory operations
- Expert-level taxonomy filters

## 3. Core Experience Loop

1. Open the app
2. Choose a path:
   - "What Can I Drink" (based on My Bar), or
   - Browse / filter all cocktails
3. Pick a drink (or use "Surprise Me")
4. View / print the recipe
5. Log it (optional)
6. Get better suggestions next time

If this loop feels fast and satisfying, the product is working.

## 4. What We Optimize For

- Low friction
- Fast decisions
- Ingredient-first discovery
- Clear recipe quantities
- Personal history awareness (avoid repeats)
- Guest-friendly defaults for first-time visitors

---

## 5. What We Are Explicitly NOT Building (For Now)

- Professional bartender mode
- POS integrations
- Inventory management software
- Social network features
- Complex tagging explosion
- Deep educational coursework

Note: "My Bar" is a lightweight checklist used to improve recommendations, not a full inventory system.

## 6. Current MVP Focus

**P0 (Critical)**
- Ingredient-first filtering ("I Feel Like Using...")
- Ingredient naming consistency (so filters and recipes work reliably)
- Clear quantity storage/display for readable recipes
- Smooth "Surprise Me" decision flow

**P1 (High)**
- Non-alcoholic support
- Better avoidance of recently logged drinks

**MVP is done when**
- A casual user can quickly choose a drink
- Recipe details are clear enough to make/print
- The app remembers enough history to reduce repeats

Everything else is secondary.

## 7. Long-Term Direction (Not Immediate)

After the core web experience feels complete and stable:
- My Bar-aware suggestions (without becoming inventory software)
- Smart substitution suggestions
- Seasonal recommendations
- Mobile app

Long-term ideas should strengthen the home-bartender decision experience, not expand into pro bar operations.
