# CocktailChooser -- Product Vision

## 1. Core Purpose

CocktailChooser is a decision engine for casual home bartenders.

It helps users quickly decide what to drink based on: - What they feel
like - What ingredients they have - What they've already tried

It is not a cocktail encyclopedia.\
It is not professional bar software.\
It is not a POS system.

It is frictionless drink decision support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Target Persona

**Primary Audience: Casual Home Bartenders**

Characteristics: - Mix drinks occasionally (weekends, gatherings,
holidays) - Own a modest but growing home bar - Do not know hundreds of
cocktail names - Think in ingredients, not recipes - Want help deciding

They typically say: - "What can I make with orange juice?" - "I want
something creamy." - "Surprise me." - "I don't want what I had last
night."

They do NOT say: - "Filter by IBA classification." - "Optimize inventory
turnover." - "Show me classic 1910s variations."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Core Experience Loop

1.  Open the app\
2.  Either:
    -   Click "Surprise Me"\
    -   Select ingredients they feel like using\
3.  Choose a drink\
4.  Log it\
5.  Avoid repeats next time

If this loop feels smooth and satisfying, the product is working.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. What We Optimize For

-   Low friction
-   Fast decisions
-   Ingredient-first discovery
-   Simple filtering
-   Clear quantities
-   Personal history awareness

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. What We Are Explicitly NOT Building (For Now)

-   Professional bartender mode
-   POS integrations
-   Inventory management software
-   Social network features
-   Complex tagging explosion
-   Deep educational coursework

These may exist later, but they are not core to the MVP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Current MVP Focus

**P0 -- Critical:** - Ingredient-based filtering ("I Feel Like
Using...") - Ingredient canonicalization strategy - Clear quantity
storage model - Maintain smooth "Surprise Me" flow

**P1 -- High:** - Non-alcoholic support - Improved exclusion of recently
logged drinks

Everything else is secondary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Long-Term Direction (Not Immediate)

Once the decision engine is strong: - Inventory-aware suggestions -
Smart substitution logic - Seasonal recommendations - Light monetization
options - Mobile app

But only after the web product feels complete and stable.
